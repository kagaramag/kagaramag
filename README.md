### Hi, I'm Gilles Kagarama ðŸ‘‹

#### UIX/Full Stack Software Engineer

An enthusiastic software engineer with 10+ years of experiences in product design participating in the complete project development lifecycleÂ focusing on UI/UX, business/system analysis, scalability, testing, CI&CD, project plan and quality assurance.
My career revolves around enterprise-level software solutions working with global tech companies and local SMEs. I always strive to define customer journeys on the platform to optimise user experience as I believe that people ignore the app that ignores them.
